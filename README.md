# Password-Generator
This repository is for test purposes only and it serves as a password generator

This project started as an exercise from SoftUni's Fundamentals unit and has since evolved into a small work-in-progress repository for generating passwords. The main goal is to practice the JS fundamentals of programming concepts and combining them into a complete working page which was made from scratch.
